				<p class="verses">
					All praises  due to Allah, the sustainer of the whole universe. He said in his holy book Al-Quran, <br>
					Say, “Shall We tell you about the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds? [103]
					Those are the ones whose effort in the worldly life has gone in vain, while they think they are doing well. [104]
					Those are the ones who rejected the signs of their Lord and (the concept of) meeting with Him, so their deeds have gone to waste, and We shall assign to them no weight at all. [105]
					That is their punishment, the Jahannam , for they disbelieved and made My signs and My messengers a mockery. [106]
					
					(Kahf:103-106) 

				</p> 
				
				<p class="verses">
					He also said,<br>
					Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah (another name of Makkah) - blessed and a guidance for the worlds. 
					 (Al-e-Imran:96).
						
				</p>
										
					
				<p class="verses">
					He also said,	<br>
					Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).(Baqarah:125)
