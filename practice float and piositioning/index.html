						Your Lord ordered you to pray Salat, five times in a day. How nicely are you praying those Salats? Do you want to pray your Salat properly? Then what is going on? 
						Does he has authority to forbade you to do some evil deeds? Do you know what he ordered you to do and what not to do? If you are crossing limits that are fixed by your Lord, then think, "Am I a real Mumin and what my Iman orders me".
						Are you reading the holy Quran regularly? At least one or two pages? If not, then ask yourself, "Your lord has sent a message. Shouldn't you read this?"
						Are you unable to complete a chapter in a week? Come on, man? In seven days? The biggest one is 63 pages. Only seven pages per day maximum. Is it impossible?
						Complete the owing of your lord, he will repay other's owing.
